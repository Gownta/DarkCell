Compiler Stages
---------------

Partial Tokenization:
  The input is converted into a list of tokens.
  Strings and comments (including herestrings) are identified at this stage.
  Other tokens are partial tokens. The string "++" will be tokenized as "+" "+".
  (Later, partial tokens will be combined to form full tokens.)
  Some character classes may never contain two tokens (e.g. [a-zA-Z]+); these are grouped at this stage.

Line Organization and Blocking:
  Logical lines are made up of multiple physical lines.
  Rules for logical lines include the contents of {}, [], and ().
  {} are turned into blocks.
  Indented sections are turned into blocks.

Syntax Parsing:
  define-syntax and define-keyword are pattern matched and analyzed.
  Syntax is matched against the token/block list.
